[//]: [![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/sjentsch/jmvReadWrite.svg?branch=main)](https://app.travis-ci.com/sjentsch/jmvReadWrite)
--->

The R-package `jmvReadWrite` reads and writes the .omv-files that are
used by the statistical spreadsheet `jamovi` (<https://www.jamovi.org>).
It is supposed to ease using syntax for statistical analyses created
using the GUI in `jamovi` in connection with the R-library `jmv`.

## Installation

You can either install a stable version of `jmvReadWrite` which is
available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=jmvReadWrite)
using the following command:

``` r
install.packages("jmvReadWrite")
```

or you can install the development version of the `jmvReadWrite` package
from [GitHub](https://github.com/sjentsch/jmvReadWrite/):

``` r
if(!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sjentsch/jmvReadWrite")
```

## How to use the package?

<br />

[**read\_omv**](https://sjentsch.github.io/jmvReadWrite/reference/read_omv.html)

The following code uses the ToothGrowth-data set that is part of the
data sets included in R (the current file contains some modifications
though for testing the reading and writing routines: `read_omv` and
`write_omv`). With this data set, a syntax to conduct an ANOVA is run.

The results should be similar to those obtained when running the same
analysis in jamovi (using the GUI). To do so, open the file menu (☰)
choose `Open`, `Data Library` and `ToothGrowth`. Afterwards, click on
the `ANOVA`-button in the `Analyses`-tab and choose `ANOVA`. There, you
assign the variable `len` to `Dependent Variable` and `supp` and `dose`
to `Fixed Factors`. Afterwards, you choose / tick `Overall Model Test`
and `ω²`. Open the drop-down menu `Assumption Checks` and tick
`Homogeneity test` and `Normality test`. The results should be identical
apart from that the table output looks nicer in `jamovi` (not only text,
as below), numbers are rounded and maybe one or two other cosmetic
differences.

If you want to copy the syntax generated in jamovi, you have to switch
on the [`Syntax
Mode`](https://jamovi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usermanual/um_6_syntax_mode.html).
Afterwards, the syntax is shown at the top of the analysis and can be
copied from there.

``` r
library(jmvReadWrite);
library(jmv);

fleOMV = system.file("extdata", "ToothGrowth.omv", package = "jmvReadWrite");
data = read_omv(fleOMV);
# if the "jmv"-package is installed, we can run a test analysis with the data
if ("jmv" %in% rownames(installed.packages())) {
    jmv::ANOVA(
        formula = len ~ supp + dose + supp:dose,
        data = data,
        effectSize = c("omega"),
        modelTest = TRUE,
        homo = TRUE,
        norm = TRUE);

Since version 0.2.0,
[`read_omv`](https://sjentsch.github.io/jmvReadWrite/reference/read_omv.html)
also extracts the syntax from analyses that you may have conducted in
the jamovi-GUI and that are stored in the .omv-file. To extract them,
you have to set the parameter `getSyn = TRUE` when calling
[`read_omv`](https://sjentsch.github.io/jmvReadWrite/reference/read_omv.html)
(default is `FALSE`). When the parameter is set, the analyses are stored
in the attribute `syntax`. They can be used as shown in the following
examples:

``` r
library(jmvReadWrite);
fleOMV = system.file("extdata", "ToothGrowth.omv", package = "jmvReadWrite");
data = read_omv(fleOMV, getSyn = TRUE);
# shows the syntax of the analyses from the .omv-file
# please note that syntax extraction may not work on all systems
# if the syntax couldn't be extracted, an empty list (length = 0) is returned,
# otherwise, the syntax of the analyses from the .omv-file is shown and  
# the commands of the first and the second analysis are run, with the
# output of the second analysis assigned to the variable result2
if (length(attr(data, "syntax")) >= 2) {
    attr(data, "syntax")
    # if the "jmv"-package is installed, we can run the analyses in "syntax"     
    if ("jmv" %in% rownames(installed.packages())) {
        eval(parse(text=attr(data, "syntax")[[1]]))
        eval(parse(text=paste0("result2 = ", attr(data, "syntax")[[2]])))
        names(result2)
        # -> "main"      "assump"    "contrasts" "postHoc"   "emm"
        # (the names of the five output tables)
    }
}
#> [1] "main"      "assump"    "contrasts" "postHoc"   "emm"       "residsOV"
```

[**write\_omv**](https://sjentsch.github.io/jmvReadWrite/reference/write_omv.html)

The `jmvReadWrite`-package also enables you to write `.omv`-files in
order to use them in `jamovi`. Let’s assume that you have a large
collection of log-files (e.g., from an experiment) that you compile and
process (summarize, filter, etc.) in R in order to later analyse them in
`jamovi`. You will have those processed log-files stored in a data frame
(called, e.g., `data`) which you then write to a file that you can open
in jamovi afterwards.

``` r
library(jmvReadWrite)

# use the data set "ToothGrowth" and, if it exists, write it as jamovi-file
# using write_omv()
data("ToothGrowth");
# "retDbg" has to be set in order to return debug information to wrtDta
wrtDta = write_omv(ToothGrowth, "Trial.omv", retDbg = TRUE);
names(wrtDta);
#> [1] "mtaDta" "xtdDta" "dtaFrm"
# -> "mtaDta" "xtdDta" "dtaFrm"
# this debug information contains a list with the metadata ("mtaDta", e.g.,
# column and data type), the extended data ("xtdDta", e.g., variable lables),
# and the data frame (dtaFrm) for checking (understanding the file format) and
# debugging

# check whether the file was written to the disk, get the file information (size, etc.)
# and delete the file afterwards
list.files(".", "Trial.omv");
#> [1] "Trial.omv"
file.info("Trial.omv");
#>           size isdir mode               mtime               ctime
#> Trial.omv 1563 FALSE  664 2022-08-08 08:15:51 2022-08-08 08:15:51
#>                         atime  uid  gid    uname   grname
#> Trial.omv 2022-08-08 08:15:51 1000 1000 sjentsch sjentsch
unlink("Trial.omv");
```

Although jamovi reads R-data files (.RData, .rda, .rds)
[`write_omv`](https://sjentsch.github.io/jmvReadWrite/reference/write_omv.html)
permits to store `jamovi`-specific attributes (such as variable labels)
in addition. Please note that if you are reading from an `.omv`-file in
order to write back to an `.omv`-file (perhaps after some
modifications), it is recommended to leave the `sveAtt`-attribute set to
`TRUE` (which is the default).

``` r
# reading and writing a file with the "sveAtt"-parameter permits you to keep
# essential meta-data to ensure that the written file looks and works like the
# original file (plus you modifications)
fleOMV = system.file("extdata", "ToothGrowth.omv", package = "jmvReadWrite");
data = read_omv(fleOMV, sveAtt = TRUE);
# shows the names of the attributes for the whole data set (e.g., number of
# rows and columns) and the names of the attributes of the first column
names(attributes(data));
#> [1] "names"       "row.names"   "class"       "fltLst"      "removedRows"
#> [6] "addedRows"   "transforms"
names(attributes(data[[1]]));
#>  [1] "missingValues"  "name"           "id"             "columnType"    
#>  [5] "dataType"       "measureType"    "formula"        "formulaMessage"
#>  [9] "parentId"       "width"          "type"           "importName"    
#> [13] "description"    "transform"      "edits"          "filterNo"      
#> [17] "active"
#
# perhaps do some modifications to the file here and write it back afterwards
write_omv(data, 'Trial.omv');
unlink("Trial.omv");
```

If `Trial.omv` in the example above would have been kept, it should look
like the original file (plus your possible modifications). If you, e.g.,
added a new column, you could adjust some attributes (e.g., to enforce a
specific `columnType` or `measurementType`): just look at how attributes
are stored for other columns. <br /><br />

**Helper functions**

Since version 0.3.0, `jmvReadWrite` contains a number of helper
functions that support you with commonly required data management tasks:

  - [`convert_to_omv`](https://sjentsch.github.io/jmvReadWrite/reference/convert_to_omv.html):
    Converts data sets from other file formats into jamovi-format (this
    function may be helpful if you have to convert a larger amount of
    files).

  - [`long2wide_omv`](https://sjentsch.github.io/jmvReadWrite/reference/long2wide_omv.html):
    Convert a data set from long to wide format (time points for
    repeated measurements are arranged as rows in the original and
    converted into columns).

  - [`wide2long_omv`](https://sjentsch.github.io/jmvReadWrite/reference/wide2long_omv.html):
    Convert a data set from wide to long format (time points for
    repeated measurements are arranged as columns in the original and
    converted into rows).

  - [`merge_cols_omv`](https://sjentsch.github.io/jmvReadWrite/reference/merge_cols_omv.html):
    Add cases from several data sets (i.e., the cases / rows in the
    second, etc. data set are added as rows to the first data set).

  - [`merge_rows_omv`](https://sjentsch.github.io/jmvReadWrite/reference/merge_rows_omv.html):
    Add variables from several data sets (i.e., the variables / columns
    in the second, etc. input data set are added as columns to the first
    data set).

  - [`sort_omv`](https://sjentsch.github.io/jmvReadWrite/reference/sort_omv.html):
    Sort a data set according to one or more variable(s).

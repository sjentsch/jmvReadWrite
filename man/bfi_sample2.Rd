\description{
The data set contains responses from 250 participants filling in twenty-five personality self-report items
taken from the International Personality Item Pool (https://ipip.ori.org) as part of the Synthetic Aperture
Personality Assessment (SAPA) web-based personality assessment (https://sapa-project.org) project.
The 25 items are organized by five putative factors: Agreeableness (A1 to A5), Conscientiousness (C1 to C5),
Extraversion (E1 to E5), Neuroticism (N1 to N5), and Openness (N1 to N5). The items were short phrases that
the respondent should answer by indicating how accurately the statement describes their typical behaviour or
attitude. Responses were collected using a 6-point scale: 1 - Very inaccurate, 2 - Moderately inaccurate,
3 - Slightly inaccurate, 4 - Slightly accurate, 5 - Moderately accurate, 6 - Very accurate.
The data set includes the jamovi-attributes. It is supposed to result in an identical file compared to the
bfi_sample2.omv-file contained in the extdata-directory of the package when written with write_omv.

# Contributing to jmvReadWrite

## Opening issues

## Development guidelines

If you'd like to contribute changes to `jmvReadWrite`, the  [GitHub

for proposing, submitting, reviewing, and accepting changes. If you haven't
done this before, there's a nice [overview of
git](https://r-pkgs.org/git.html), as well as [best practices for submitting
pull requests](http://r-pkgs.org/git.html#pr-make) in the R packages book by
Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan.

You are also welcome to contribute further checks / tests to `jmvReadWrite`.
Please discuss any proposed new checks by opening an issue on the GitHub
repository.

The `jmvReadWrite` coding style follows the commonly used [tidyverse style
guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#spacing).
